This repository holds the course materials for Cloudera's Services
Enablement Boot Camp.

If you've received this repo as a ZIP file via email, please follow
the instructions that were included to initialize your repo.

You can make your GitHub repo Private or Public.  It does not matter
to the course which option you use.

<strong>NOTE</strong>: GitHub lets you upload new files and edit
them online. Don't do this. Use your GitHub repo as a destination
for your published lab work. Make sure at all times that the most
recent version of your work is on your laptop.

Make your instructors Collaborators on your GitHub repo. This
privilege lets them see the repo and create branches of revised
content. If you're unfamiliar with git, we'll review the process
of managing content as part of class.

We will use GitHub's Issues feature to track your progress. For
each section, we'll ask you to create one Issue and use it to log
your progress. We will use GitHub Labels to mark the state of
each lab (e.g., started, submitted, evaluated). Finally, we'll use
GitHub's Milestones to categorize your lab and challenge work. 

In a large class, it may take time for an instructor to assist you.
If you have a problem in lab, describe in your current Issue what
the problem is. This comment could include copying an error message
or stack trace into the Issue dialog, or capturing a screen that
shows your cluster's condition. This way you don't have to keep the
details in mind until you get some help.

Before you look at the content or start lab work, make the following
changes to your GitHub repo settings:

* Add your collaborators under `Settings -> Collaborators`.
* Enable `Issues` under `Settings -> Options`. Click the `Features` box and check `Issues`.
* Click the `Issues` tab and the `Milestones` button
    * Create two milestones: `Labs` and `Challenges`
    * Set the deadlines for Thursday and Friday of the training week, respectively.
* Click the `Labels` button and change your labels as follows:
    * Leave the `bug` Issue as is
    * Change `duplicate` to `started`
    * Change `enhancement` to `submitted`
    * Change `help wanted` to `evaluated`
    * Leave the `invalid` Issue as is
    * Change `wontfix` to `incomplete`; set the label color to yellow (`#fbca04`).
    * Leave the `question` Issue as is
